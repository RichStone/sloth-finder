<h1>Sloth Finder - Ruby Weekly edition</h1>

<p>
  Sloth Finder helps you detect the most amazing Ruby articles around your favorite
  Ruby and Rails topics for the past decade.
</p>

<p>What makes it Sloth?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It's the laziest search ever invented (we are looking for case insensitive words with open ends; e.g. "api" will match "API", "APIs", "apimatic")</li>
  <li>It's slow: I've seen loading times for about 1-2 seconds. Chill out bro.</li>
  <li>Written with the laziest tech stack ever imagined: Rails on SQlite ("sqlite" is a great keyword to have Findings for, by the way).</li>
  <li>Frontend "design" outsourced to Claude Opus.</li>
  <li>Obviously, no one wrote tests for this simple MVP.</li>
</ul>

<%= form_with url: findings_path, method: :post do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :keywords %>
  <%= form.text_field :keywords %>
  <%= form.submit "Find ðŸ¦¥" %>
<% end %>

<div id="results">
  <%= render "results", results: @results || [] %>
</div>
