<h2>What makes it Sloth?</h2>

<ul>
  <li class="emoji-sloth">Minimal effort development for max benefit.</li>
  <li class="emoji-search">It's the laziest search ever invented (we are looking for case insensitive words with open ends; e.g. "api" will match "API", "APIs", "apimatic")</li>
  <li class="emoji-slow">It's slow: Loading times have been spotted to be around 1-2 seconds on local and more in prod. Chill is king; good things take time.</li>
  <li class="emoji-rails">Written with the laziest tech stack ever imagined, the one-sloth-framework: Rails on SQlite deployed on Render ($7.25 server costs, <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/richstoneio" target="_blank">consider buying a banana for Sloth if you got any value from the tool</a>).</li>
  <li class="emoji-claude">Frontend "design" outsourced to Claude Opus.</li>
  <li class="emoji-tests">Obviously, no one wrote tests for this simple MVP (the Sloth promised adding some, if we go past MVP and add more features).</li>
</ul>
